#  6.20. Graph Management

This section describes the graph management functions of CUDA runtime application programming interface.

##  6.20.1. Functions

`` __host__ cudaError_t cudaDeviceGetGraphMemAttribute(int device, enum cudaGraphMemAttributeType attr, void *value) ``

Valid attributes are:

  * cudaGraphMemAttrUsedMemCurrent: Amount of memory, in bytes, currently associated with graphs

  * cudaGraphMemAttrUsedMemHigh: High watermark of memory, in bytes, associated with graphs since the last time it was reset. High watermark can only be reset to zero.

  * cudaGraphMemAttrReservedMemCurrent: Amount of memory, in bytes, currently allocated for use by the CUDA graphs asynchronous allocator.

  * cudaGraphMemAttrReservedMemHigh: High watermark of memory, in bytes, currently allocated for use by the CUDA graphs asynchronous allocator.

`` __host__ cudaError_t cudaGraphAddEmptyNode(cudaGraphNode_t *pGraphNode, cudaGraph_t graph, const cudaGraphNode_t *pDependencies, size_t numDependencies) ``

Creates an empty node and adds it to a graph.

Creates a new node which performs no operation, and adds it to `graph` with `numDependencies` dependencies specified via `pDependencies`. It is possible for `numDependencies` to be 0, in which case the node will be placed at the root of the graph. `pDependencies` may not have any duplicate entries. A handle to the new node will be returned in `pGraphNode`.

An empty node performs no operation during execution, but can be used for transitive ordering. For example, a phased execution graph with 2 groups of n nodes with a barrier between them can be represented using an empty node and 2*n dependency edges, rather than no empty node and n^2 dependency edges.

`` __host__ cudaError_t cudaGraphAddKernelNode(cudaGraphNode_t *pGraphNode, cudaGraph_t graph, const cudaGraphNode_t *pDependencies, size_t numDependencies, const struct cudaKernelNodeParams *pNodeParams) ``

Creates a kernel execution node and adds it to a graph.

Creates a new kernel execution node and adds it to `graph` with `numDependencies` dependencies specified via `pDependencies` and arguments specified in `pNodeParams`. It is possible for `numDependencies` to be 0, in which case the node will be placed at the root of the graph. `pDependencies` may not have any duplicate entries. A handle to the new node will be returned in `pGraphNode`.

The cudaKernelNodeParams structure is defined as:

```cpp
struct cudaKernelNodeParams
{
    void* func;
    dim3 gridDim;
    dim3 blockDim;
    unsigned int sharedMemBytes;
    void **kernelParams;
    void **extra;
};
```

When the graph is launched, the node will invoke kernel `func` on a (`gridDim.x` x `gridDim.y` x `gridDim.z`) grid of blocks. Each block contains (`blockDim.x` x `blockDim.y` x `blockDim.z`) threads.

`sharedMem` sets the amount of dynamic shared memory that will be available to each thread block.

Kernel parameters to `func` can be specified in one of two ways:

1) Kernel parameters can be specified via `kernelParams`. If the kernel has N parameters, then `kernelParams` needs to be an array of N pointers. Each pointer, from `kernelParams`[0] to `kernelParams`[N-1], points to the region of memory from which the actual parameter will be copied. The number of kernel parameters and their offsets and sizes do not need to be specified as that information is retrieved directly from the kernel’s image.

2) Kernel parameters can also be packaged by the application into a single buffer that is passed in via `extra`. This places the burden on the application of knowing each kernel parameter’s size and alignment/padding within the buffer. The `extra` parameter exists to allow this function to take additional less commonly used arguments. `extra` specifies a list of names of extra settings and their corresponding values. Each extra setting name is immediately followed by the corresponding value. The list must be terminated with either NULL or CU_LAUNCH_PARAM_END.

  * ::CU_LAUNCH_PARAM_END, which indicates the end of the `extra` array;

  * ::CU_LAUNCH_PARAM_BUFFER_POINTER, which specifies that the next value in `extra` will be a pointer to a buffer containing all the kernel parameters for launching kernel `func`;

  * ::CU_LAUNCH_PARAM_BUFFER_SIZE, which specifies that the next value in `extra` will be a pointer to a size_t containing the size of the buffer specified with ::CU_LAUNCH_PARAM_BUFFER_POINTER;

The error cudaErrorInvalidValue will be returned if kernel parameters are specified with both `kernelParams` and `extra` (i.e. both `kernelParams` and `extra` are non-NULL).

The `kernelParams` or `extra` array, as well as the argument values it points to, are copied during this call.

Note

Kernels launched using graphs must not use texture and surface references. Reading or writing through any texture or surface reference is undefined behavior. This restriction does not apply to texture and surface objects.

Note

Graph objects are not threadsafe. More here.

Note

Note that this function may also return error codes from previous, asynchronous launches.

Note

Note that this function may also return cudaErrorInitializationError, cudaErrorInsufficientDriver or cudaErrorNoDevice if this call tries to initialize internal CUDA RT state.

Note

Note that as specified by cudaStreamAddCallback no CUDA function may be called from callback. cudaErrorNotPermitted may, but is not guaranteed to, be returned as a diagnostic in such case.

Note

The API can also be used with a kernel cudaKernel_t by querying the handle using cudaLibraryGetKernel() or cudaGetKernel and then passing it to the API by casting to void*. The symbol `entryFuncAddr` passed to cudaGetKernel should be a symbol that is registered with the same CUDA Runtime instance.

Note

Passing a symbol that belongs that belongs to a different runtime instance will result in undefined behavior. The only type that can be reliably passed to a different runtime instance is cudaKernel_t

Parameters

  * **pGraphNode** – - Returns newly created node

  * **graph** – - Graph to which to add the node

  * **pDependencies** – - Dependencies of the node

  * **numDependencies** – - Number of dependencies

  * **pNodeParams** – - Parameters for the GPU execution node

Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue, cudaErrorInvalidDeviceFunction

`` __host__ cudaError_t cudaGraphAddMemAllocNode(cudaGraphNode_t *pGraphNode, cudaGraph_t graph, const cudaGraphNode_t *pDependencies, size_t numDependencies, struct cudaMemAllocNodeParams *nodeParams) ``

Creates an allocation node and adds it to a graph.

Creates a new allocation node and adds it to `graph` with `numDependencies` dependencies specified via `pDependencies` and arguments specified in `nodeParams`. It is possible for `numDependencies` to be 0, in which case the node will be placed at the root of the graph. `pDependencies` may not have any duplicate entries. A handle to the new node will be returned in `pGraphNode`.

When cudaGraphAddMemAllocNode creates an allocation node, it returns the address of the allocation in `nodeParams.dptr`. The allocation’s address remains fixed across instantiations and launches.

If the allocation is freed in the same graph, by creating a free node using cudaGraphAddMemFreeNode, the allocation can be accessed by nodes ordered after the allocation node but before the free node. These allocations cannot be freed outside the owning graph, and they can only be freed once in the owning graph.

If the allocation is not freed in the same graph, then it can be accessed not only by nodes in the graph which are ordered after the allocation node, but also by stream operations ordered after the graph’s execution but before the allocation is freed.

Allocations which are not freed in the same graph can be freed by:

  * passing the allocation to ::cudaMemFreeAsync or ::cudaMemFree;

  * launching a graph with a free node for that allocation; or

  * specifying cudaGraphInstantiateFlagAutoFreeOnLaunch during instantiation, which makes each launch behave as though it called ::cudaMemFreeAsync for every unfreed allocation.

It is not possible to free an allocation in both the owning graph and another graph. If the allocation is freed in the same graph, a free node cannot be added to another graph. If the allocation is freed in another graph, a free node can no longer be added to the owning graph.

The following restrictions apply to graphs which contain allocation and/or memory free nodes:

  * Nodes and edges of the graph cannot be deleted.

  * The graph can only be used in a child node if the ownership is moved to the parent.

  * Only one instantiation of the graph may exist at any point in time.

  * The graph cannot be cloned.

Creates a memory free node and adds it to a graph.

Creates a new memory free node and adds it to `graph` with `numDependencies` dependencies specified via `pDependencies` and address specified in `dptr`. It is possible for `numDependencies` to be 0, in which case the node will be placed at the root of the graph. `pDependencies` may not have any duplicate entries. A handle to the new node will be returned in `pGraphNode`.

cudaGraphAddMemFreeNode will return cudaErrorInvalidValue if the user attempts to free:

  * an allocation twice in the same graph.

  * an address that was not returned by an allocation node.

  * an invalid address.

The following restrictions apply to graphs which contain allocation and/or memory free nodes:

  * Nodes and edges of the graph cannot be deleted.

  * The graph can only be used in a child node if the ownership is moved to the parent.

  * Only one instantiation of the graph may exist at any point in time.

`` __host__ cudaError_t cudaGraphAddMemcpyNode1D(cudaGraphNode_t *pGraphNode, cudaGraph_t graph, const cudaGraphNode_t *pDependencies, size_t numDependencies, void *dst, const void *src, size_t count, enum cudaMemcpyKind kind) ``

Creates a 1D memcpy node and adds it to a graph.

Creates a new 1D memcpy node and adds it to `graph` with `numDependencies` dependencies specified via `pDependencies`. It is possible for `numDependencies` to be 0, in which case the node will be placed at the root of the graph. `pDependencies` may not have any duplicate entries. A handle to the new node will be returned in `pGraphNode`.

When the graph is launched, the node will copy `count` bytes from the memory area pointed to by `src` to the memory area pointed to by `dst`, where `kind` specifies the direction of the copy, and must be one of cudaMemcpyHostToHost, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice, or cudaMemcpyDefault. Passing cudaMemcpyDefault is recommended, in which case the type of transfer is inferred from the pointer values. However, cudaMemcpyDefault is only allowed on systems that support unified virtual addressing. Launching a memcpy node with dst and src pointers that do not match the direction of the copy results in an undefined behavior.

Memcpy nodes have some additional restrictions with regards to managed memory, if the system contains at least one device which has a zero value for the device attribute cudaDevAttrConcurrentManagedAccess.

`` __host__ cudaError_t cudaGraphExecChildGraphNodeSetParams(cudaGraphExec_t hGraphExec, cudaGraphNode_t node, cudaGraph_t childGraph) ``

Updates node parameters in the child graph node in the given graphExec.

Updates the work represented by `node` in `hGraphExec` as though the nodes contained in `node's` graph had the parameters contained in `childGraph's` nodes at instantiation. `node` must remain in the graph which was used to instantiate `hGraphExec`. Changed edges to and from `node` are ignored.

The modifications only affect future launches of `hGraphExec`. Already enqueued or running launches of `hGraphExec` are not affected by this call. `node` is also not modified by this call.

The topology of `childGraph`, as well as the node insertion order, must match that of the graph contained in `node`. See cudaGraphExecUpdate() for a list of restrictions on what can be updated in an instantiated graph. The update is recursive, so child graph nodes contained within the top level child graph will also be updated.

`` __host__ cudaError_t cudaGraphExecExternalSemaphoresSignalNodeSetParams(cudaGraphExec_t hGraphExec, cudaGraphNode_t hNode, const struct cudaExternalSemaphoreSignalNodeParams *nodeParams) ``

Sets the parameters for an external semaphore signal node in the given graphExec.

Sets the parameters of an external semaphore signal node in an executable graph `hGraphExec`. The node is identified by the corresponding node `hNode` in the non-executable graph, from which the executable graph was instantiated.

`hNode` must not have been removed from the original graph.

The modifications only affect future launches of `hGraphExec`. Already enqueued or running launches of `hGraphExec` are not affected by this call. `hNode` is also not modified by this call.

Changing `nodeParams->numExtSems` is not supported.

Parameters

  * **hGraphExec** – - The executable graph in which to set the specified node

  * **node** – - Host node from the graph which was used to instantiate graphExec

  * **pNodeParams** – - Updated Parameters to set

Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue,

`` __host__ cudaError_t cudaGraphExecKernelNodeSetParams(cudaGraphExec_t hGraphExec, cudaGraphNode_t node, const struct cudaKernelNodeParams *pNodeParams) ``

Sets the parameters for a kernel node in the given graphExec.

Sets the parameters of a kernel node in an executable graph `hGraphExec`. The node is identified by the corresponding node `node` in the non-executable graph, from which the executable graph was instantiated.

`node` must not have been removed from the original graph. All `nodeParams` fields may change, but the following restrictions apply to `func` updates:

  * The owning device of the function cannot change.

  * A node whose function originally did not use CUDA dynamic parallelism cannot be updated to a function which uses CDP

  * A node whose function originally did not make device-side update calls cannot be updated to a function which makes device-side update calls.

  * If `hGraphExec` was not instantiated for device launch, a node whose function originally did not use device-side cudaGraphLaunch() cannot be updated to a function which uses device-side cudaGraphLaunch() unless the node resides on the same device as nodes which contained such calls at instantiate-time. If no such calls were present at instantiation, these updates cannot be performed at all.

The modifications only affect future launches of `hGraphExec`. Already enqueued or running launches of `hGraphExec` are not affected by this call. `node` is also not modified by this call.

If `node` is a device-updatable kernel node, the next upload/launch of `hGraphExec` will overwrite any previous device-side updates. Additionally, applying host updates to a device-updatable kernel node while it is being updated from the device will result in undefined behavior.

Note

Note that as specified by cudaStreamAddCallback no CUDA function may be called from callback. cudaErrorNotPermitted may, but is not guaranteed to, be returned as a diagnostic in such case.

Note

The API can also be used with a kernel cudaKernel_t by querying the handle using cudaLibraryGetKernel() or cudaGetKernel and then passing it to the API by casting to void*. The symbol `entryFuncAddr` passed to cudaGetKernel should be a symbol that is registered with the same CUDA Runtime instance.

Note

Passing a symbol that belongs that belongs to a different runtime instance will result in undefined behavior. The only type that can be reliably passed to a different runtime instance is cudaKernel_t

Parameters

  * **hGraphExec** – - The executable graph in which to set the specified node

  * **node** – - kernel node from the graph from which graphExec was instantiated

  * **pNodeParams** – - Updated Parameters to set

Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue,

Updates the work represented by `node` in `hGraphExec` as though `node` had contained `pNodeParams` at instantiation. `node` must remain in the graph which was used to instantiate `hGraphExec`. Changed edges to and from `node` are ignored.

The source and destination memory in `pNodeParams` must be allocated from the same contexts as the original source and destination memory. Both the instantiation-time memory operands and the memory operands in `pNodeParams` must be 1-dimensional. Zero-length operations are not supported.

The modifications only affect future launches of `hGraphExec`. Already enqueued or running launches of `hGraphExec` are not affected by this call. `node` is also not modified by this call.

`` __host__ cudaError_t cudaGraphExecMemsetNodeSetParams(cudaGraphExec_t hGraphExec, cudaGraphNode_t node, const struct cudaMemsetParams *pNodeParams) ``

Sets the parameters for a memset node in the given graphExec.

Updates the work represented by `node` in `hGraphExec` as though `node` had contained `pNodeParams` at instantiation. `node` must remain in the graph which was used to instantiate `hGraphExec`. Changed edges to and from `node` are ignored.

Parameters

  * **graphExec** – - The executable graph in which to update the specified node

`` __host__ cudaError_t cudaGraphExecUpdate(cudaGraphExec_t hGraphExec, cudaGraph_t hGraph, cudaGraphExecUpdateResultInfo *resultInfo) ``

Check whether an executable graph can be updated with a graph and perform the update if possible.

Updates the node parameters in the instantiated graph specified by `hGraphExec` with the node parameters in a topologically identical graph specified by `hGraph`.

Limitations:

  * Kernel nodes:

    * The owning context of the function cannot change.

    * A node whose function originally did not use CUDA dynamic parallelism cannot be updated to a function which uses CDP.

    * A node whose function originally did not make device-side update calls cannot be updated to a function which makes device-side update calls.

    * A cooperative node cannot be updated to a non-cooperative node, and vice-versa.

    * If the graph was instantiated with cudaGraphInstantiateFlagUseNodePriority, the priority attribute cannot change. Equality is checked on the originally requested priority values, before they are clamped to the device’s supported range.

    * If `hGraphExec` was not instantiated for device launch, a node whose function originally did not use device-side cudaGraphLaunch() cannot be updated to a function which uses device-side cudaGraphLaunch() unless the node resides on the same device as nodes which contained such calls at instantiate-time. If no such calls were present at instantiation, these updates cannot be performed at all.

    * Neither `hGraph` nor `hGraphExec` may contain device-updatable kernel nodes.

  * Memset and memcpy nodes:

    * The CUDA device(s) to which the operand(s) was allocated/mapped cannot change.

    * The source/destination memory must be allocated from the same contexts as the original source/destination memory.

    * For 2d memsets, only address and assigned value may be updated.

    * For 1d memsets, updating dimensions is also allowed, but may fail if the resulting operation doesn’t map onto the work resources already allocated for the node.

  * Additional memcpy node restrictions:

    * Changing either the source or destination memory type(i.e. CU_MEMORYTYPE_DEVICE, CU_MEMORYTYPE_ARRAY, etc.) is not supported.

  * Conditional nodes:

    * Changing node parameters is not supported.

    * Changing parameters of nodes within the conditional body graph is subject to the rules above.

    * Conditional handle flags and default values are updated as part of the graph update.

Note: The API may add further restrictions in future releases. The return code should always be checked.

cudaGraphExecUpdate sets the result member of `resultInfo` to cudaGraphExecUpdateErrorTopologyChanged under the following conditions:

  * The count of nodes directly in `hGraphExec` and `hGraph` differ, in which case resultInfo->errorNode is set to NULL.

  * `hGraph` has more exit nodes than `hGraph`, in which case resultInfo->errorNode is set to one of the exit nodes in hGraph.

  * A node in `hGraph` has a different number of dependencies than the node from `hGraphExec` it is paired with, in which case resultInfo->errorNode is set to the node from `hGraph`.

  * A node in `hGraph` has a dependency that does not match with the corresponding dependency of the paired node from `hGraphExec`. resultInfo->errorNode will be set to the node from `hGraph`. resultInfo->errorFromNode will be set to the mismatched dependency. The dependencies are paired based on edge order and a dependency does not match when the nodes are already paired based on other edges examined in the graph.

cudaGraphExecUpdate sets `the` result member of `resultInfo` to:

  * cudaGraphExecUpdateError if passed an invalid value.

  * cudaGraphExecUpdateErrorTopologyChanged if the graph topology changed

  * cudaGraphExecUpdateErrorNodeTypeChanged if the type of a node changed, in which case `hErrorNode_out` is set to the node from `hGraph`.

  * cudaGraphExecUpdateErrorFunctionChanged if the function of a kernel node changed (CUDA driver < 11.2)

  * cudaGraphExecUpdateErrorUnsupportedFunctionChange if the func field of a kernel changed in an unsupported way(see note above), in which case `hErrorNode_out` is set to the node from `hGraph`

  * cudaGraphExecUpdateErrorParametersChanged if any parameters to a node changed in a way that is not supported, in which case `hErrorNode_out` is set to the node from `hGraph`

  * cudaGraphExecUpdateErrorAttributesChanged if any attributes of a node changed in a way that is not supported, in which case `hErrorNode_out` is set to the node from `hGraph`

  * cudaGraphExecUpdateErrorNotSupported if something about a node is unsupported, like the node’s type or configuration, in which case `hErrorNode_out` is set to the node from `hGraph`

If the update fails for a reason not listed above, the result member of `resultInfo` will be set to cudaGraphExecUpdateError. If the update succeeds, the result member will be set to cudaGraphExecUpdateSuccess.

cudaGraphExecUpdate returns cudaSuccess when the updated was performed successfully. It returns cudaErrorGraphExecUpdateFailure if the graph update was not performed because it included changes which violated constraints specific to instantiated graph update.

`` __host__ cudaError_t cudaGraphGetEdges(cudaGraph_t graph, cudaGraphNode_t *from, cudaGraphNode_t *to, cudaGraphEdgeData *edgeData, size_t *numEdges) ``

Returns a graph’s dependency edges.

Returns a list of `graph's` dependency edges. Edges are returned via corresponding indices in `from`, `to` and `edgeData`; that is, the node in `to`[i] has a dependency on the node in `from`[i] with data `edgeData`[i]. `from` and `to` may both be NULL, in which case this function only returns the number of edges in `numEdges`. Otherwise, `numEdges` entries will be filled in. If `numEdges` is higher than the actual number of edges, the remaining entries in `from` and `to` will be set to NULL, and the number of edges actually returned will be written to `numEdges`. `edgeData` may alone be NULL, in which case the edges must all have default (zeroed) edge data. Attempting a losst query via NULL `edgeData` will result in cudaErrorLossyQuery. If `edgeData` is non-NULL then `from` and `to` must be as well.

`` __host__ cudaError_t cudaGraphInstantiate(cudaGraphExec_t *pGraphExec, cudaGraph_t graph, unsigned long long flags = 0) ``

Creates an executable graph from a graph.

Instantiates `graph` as an executable graph. The graph is validated for any structural constraints or intra-node constraints which were not previously validated. If instantiation is successful, a handle to the instantiated graph is returned in `pGraphExec`.

The `flags` parameter controls the behavior of instantiation and subsequent graph launches. Valid flags are:

  * cudaGraphInstantiateFlagAutoFreeOnLaunch, which configures a graph containing memory allocation nodes to automatically free any unfreed memory allocations before the graph is relaunched.

  * cudaGraphInstantiateFlagDeviceLaunch, which configures the graph for launch from the device. If this flag is passed, the executable graph handle returned can be used to launch the graph from both the host and device. This flag cannot be used in conjunction with cudaGraphInstantiateFlagAutoFreeOnLaunch.

  * cudaGraphInstantiateFlagUseNodePriority, which causes the graph to use the priorities from the per-node attributes rather than the priority of the launch stream during execution. Note that priorities are only available on kernel nodes, and are copied from stream priority during stream capture.

If `graph` contains any allocation or free nodes, there can be at most one executable graph in existence for that graph at a time. An attempt to instantiate a second executable graph before destroying the first with cudaGraphExecDestroy will result in an error. The same also applies if `graph` contains any device-updatable kernel nodes.

Graphs instantiated for launch on the device have additional restrictions which do not apply to host graphs:

  * The graph’s nodes must reside on a single device.

  * The graph can only contain kernel nodes, memcpy nodes, memset nodes, and child graph nodes.

  * The graph cannot be empty and must contain at least one kernel, memcpy, or memset node. Operation-specific restrictions are outlined below.

  * Kernel nodes:

    * Use of CUDA Dynamic Parallelism is not permitted.

    * Cooperative launches are permitted as long as MPS is not in use.

  * Memcpy nodes:

    * Only copies involving device memory and/or pinned device-mapped host memory are permitted.

    * Copies involving CUDA arrays are not permitted.

    * Both operands must be accessible from the current device, and the current device must match the device of other nodes in the graph.

If `graph` is not instantiated for launch on the device but contains kernels which call device-side cudaGraphLaunch() from multiple devices, this will result in an error.

`` __host__ cudaError_t cudaGraphInstantiateWithFlags(cudaGraphExec_t *pGraphExec, cudaGraph_t graph, unsigned long long flags = 0) ``

Creates an executable graph from a graph.

Instantiates `graph` as an executable graph. The graph is validated for any structural constraints or intra-node constraints which were not previously validated. If instantiation is successful, a handle to the instantiated graph is returned in `pGraphExec`.

The `flags` parameter controls the behavior of instantiation and subsequent graph launches. Valid flags are:

  * cudaGraphInstantiateFlagAutoFreeOnLaunch, which configures a graph containing memory allocation nodes to automatically free any unfreed memory allocations before the graph is relaunched.

  * cudaGraphInstantiateFlagDeviceLaunch, which configures the graph for launch from the device. If this flag is passed, the executable graph handle returned can be used to launch the graph from both the host and device. This flag can only be used on platforms which support unified addressing. This flag cannot be used in conjunction with cudaGraphInstantiateFlagAutoFreeOnLaunch.

  * cudaGraphInstantiateFlagUseNodePriority, which causes the graph to use the priorities from the per-node attributes rather than the priority of the launch stream during execution. Note that priorities are only available on kernel nodes, and are copied from stream priority during stream capture.

If `graph` contains any allocation or free nodes, there can be at most one executable graph in existence for that graph at a time.

`` __host__ cudaError_t cudaGraphInstantiateWithParams(cudaGraphExec_t *pGraphExec, cudaGraph_t graph, cudaGraphInstantiateParams *instantiateParams) ``

Creates an executable graph from a graph.

Instantiates `graph` as an executable graph according to the `instantiateParams` structure. The graph is validated for any structural constraints or intra-node constraints which were not previously validated. If instantiation is successful, a handle to the instantiated graph is returned in `pGraphExec`.

`instantiateParams` controls the behavior of instantiation and subsequent graph launches, as well as returning more detailed information in the event of an error. cudaGraphInstantiateParams is defined as:

```cpp
typedef struct {
    unsigned long long flags;
    cudaStream_t uploadStream;
    cudaGraphNode_t errNode_out;
    cudaGraphInstantiateResult result_out;
} cudaGraphInstantiateParams;
```

The `flags` field controls the behavior of instantiation and subsequent graph launches. Valid flags are:

  * cudaGraphInstantiateFlagAutoFreeOnLaunch, which configures a graph containing memory allocation nodes to automatically free any unfreed memory allocations before the graph is relaunched.

  * cudaGraphInstantiateFlagUpload, which will perform an upload of the graph into `uploadStream` once the graph has been instantiated.

  * cudaGraphInstantiateFlagDeviceLaunch, which configures the graph for launch from the device. If this flag is passed, the executable graph handle returned can be used to launch the graph from both the host and device. This flag can only be used on platforms which support unified addressing. This flag cannot be used in conjunction with cudaGraphInstantiateFlagAutoFreeOnLaunch.

  * cudaGraphInstantiateFlagUseNodePriority, which causes the graph to use the priorities from the per-node attributes rather than the priority of the launch stream during execution. Note that priorities are only available on kernel nodes, and are copied from stream priority during stream capture.

If `graph` contains any allocation or free nodes, there can be at most one executable graph in existence for that graph at a time. An attempt to instantiate a second executable graph before destroying the first with cudaGraphExecDestroy will result in an error. The same also applies if `graph` contains any device-updatable kernel nodes.

If `graph` contains kernels which call device-side cudaGraphLaunch() from multiple devices, this will result in an error.

Graphs instantiated for launch on the device have additional restrictions which do not apply to host graphs:

  * The graph’s nodes must reside on a single device.

  * The graph can only contain kernel nodes, memcpy nodes, memset nodes, and child graph nodes.

  * The graph cannot be empty and must contain at least one kernel, memcpy, or memset node. Operation-specific restrictions are outlined below.

  * Kernel nodes:

    * Use of CUDA Dynamic Parallelism is not permitted.

    * Cooperative launches are permitted as long as MPS is not in use.

  * Memcpy nodes:

    * Only copies involving device memory and/or pinned device-mapped host memory are permitted.

    * Copies involving CUDA arrays are not permitted.

    * Both operands must be accessible from the current device, and the current device must match the device of other nodes in the graph.

In the event of an error, the `result_out` and `errNode_out` fields will contain more information about the nature of the error. Possible error reporting includes:

  * cudaGraphInstantiateError, if passed an invalid value or if an unexpected error occurred which is described by the return value of the function. `errNode_out` will be set to NULL.

  * cudaGraphInstantiateInvalidStructure, if the graph structure is invalid. `errNode_out` will be set to one of the offending nodes.

  * cudaGraphInstantiateNodeOperationNotSupported, if the graph is instantiated for device launch but contains a node of an unsupported node type, or a node which performs unsupported operations, such as use of CUDA dynamic parallelism within a kernel node. `errNode_out` will be set to this node.

  * cudaGraphInstantiateMultipleDevicesNotSupported, if the graph is instantiated for device launch but a node’s device differs from that of another node. This error can also be returned if a graph is not instantiated for device launch and it contains kernels which call device-side cudaGraphLaunch() from multiple devices. `errNode_out` will be set to this node.

If instantiation is successful, `result_out` will be set to cudaGraphInstantiateSuccess, and `hErrNode_out` will be set to NULL.

Each entry in `updates` must specify a node to update, the type of update to apply, and the parameters for that type of update. See the documentation for cudaGraphKernelNodeUpdate for more detail.

If this function is called for the node’s immediate dependent and that dependent is configured for programmatic dependent launch, then a memory fence must be invoked via __threadfence() before kickoff of the dependent is triggered via cudaTriggerProgrammaticLaunchCompletion() to ensure that the update is visible to that dependent node before it is launched.

Note

Note that this function may also return error codes from previous, asynchronous launches.

Parameters

  * **updates** – - The updates to apply

  * **updateCount** – - The number of updates to apply

Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue

`` __host__ cudaError_t cudaGraphLaunch(cudaGraphExec_t graphExec, cudaStream_t stream) ``

Launches an executable graph in a stream.

Executes `graphExec` in `stream`. Only one instance of `graphExec` may be executing at a time. Each launch is ordered behind both any previous work in `stream` and any previous launches of `graphExec`. To execute a graph concurrently, it must be instantiated multiple times into multiple executable graphs.

If any allocations created by `graphExec` remain unfreed (from a previous launch) and `graphExec` was not instantiated with cudaGraphInstantiateFlagAutoFreeOnLaunch, the launch will fail with cudaErrorInvalidValue.

Sets a memcpy node’s parameters to perform a 1-dimensional copy.

Sets the parameters of memcpy node `node` to the copy described by the provided parameters.

When the graph is launched, the node will copy `count` bytes from the memory area pointed to by `src` to the memory area pointed to by `dst`, where `kind` specifies the direction of the copy, and must be one of cudaMemcpyHostToHost, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice, or cudaMemcpyDefault.

Returns a graph node’s parameters.

Returns the parameters of graph node `node` in `*nodeParams`.

The returned parameters are a description of the node, but may not be identical to the struct provided at creation and may not be suitable for direct creation of identical nodes. This is because parameters may be partially unspecified and filled in by the driver at creation, may reference non-copyable handles, or may describe ownership semantics or other parameters that govern behavior of node creation but are not part of the final functional descriptor.

`` __host__ cudaError_t cudaGraphRemoveDependencies(cudaGraph_t graph, const cudaGraphNode_t *from, const cudaGraphNode_t *to, const cudaGraphEdgeData *edgeData, size_t numDependencies) ``

Removes dependency edges from a graph.

The number of `pDependencies` to be removed is defined by `numDependencies`. Elements in `pFrom` and `pTo` at corresponding indices define a dependency. Each node in `pFrom` and `pTo` must belong to `graph`.

If `numDependencies` is 0, elements in `pFrom` and `pTo` will be ignored. Specifying an edge that does not exist in the graph, with data matching `edgeData`, results in an error. `edgeData` is nullable, which is equivalent to passing default (zeroed) data for each edge.

Each upload is ordered behind both any previous work in `stream` and any previous launches of `graphExec`. Uses memory cached by `stream` to back the allocations owned by `graphExec`.

Note

Note that this function may also return error codes from previous, asynchronous launches.

Note

Note that this function may also return cudaErrorInitializationError, cudaErrorInsufficientDriver or cudaErrorNoDevice if this call tries to initialize internal CUDA RT state.

Parameters

  * **graphExec** – - Executable graph to upload

  * **stream** – - Stream in which to upload the graph

Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue,

`` __host__ cudaError_t cudaUserObjectCreate(cudaUserObject_t *object_out, void *ptr, cudaHostFn_t destroy, unsigned int initialRefcount, unsigned int flags) ``

Create a user object.

Create a user object with the specified destructor callback and initial reference count. The initial references are owned by the caller.

Destructor callbacks cannot make CUDA API calls and should avoid blocking behavior, as they are executed by a shared internal thread. Another thread may be signaled to perform such actions, if it does not block forward progress of tasks scheduled through CUDA.

See CUDA User Objects in the CUDA C++ Programming Guide for more information on user objects.

Parameters

  * **object_out** – - Location to return the user object handle

  * **ptr** – - The pointer to pass to the destroy function

  * **destroy** – - Callback to free the user object when it is no longer in use

  * **initialRefcount** – - The initial refcount to create the object with, typically 1. The initial references are owned by the calling thread.

  * **flags** – - Currently it is required to pass cudaUserObjectNoDestructorSync, which is the only defined flag. This indicates that the destroy callback cannot be waited on by any CUDA API. Users requiring synchronization of the callback should signal its completion manually.

Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue

`` __host__ cudaError_t cudaUserObjectRelease(cudaUserObject_t object, unsigned int count = 1) ``

Release a reference to a user object.

Releases user object references owned by the caller. The object’s destructor is invoked if the reference count reaches zero.

It is undefined behavior to release references not owned by the caller, or to use a user object handle after all references are released.

See CUDA User Objects in the CUDA C++ Programming Guide for more information on user objects.

Parameters

  * **object** – - The object to release

  * **count** – - The number of references to release, typically 1. Must be nonzero and not larger than INT_MAX.

Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue

`` __host__ cudaError_t cudaUserObjectRetain(cudaUserObject_t object, unsigned int count = 1) ``

Retain a reference to a user object.

Retains new references to a user object. The new references are owned by the caller.

See CUDA User Objects in the CUDA C++ Programming Guide for more information on user objects.

Parameters

  * **object** – - The object to retain

  * **count** – - The number of references to retain, typically 1. Must be nonzero and not larger than INT_MAX.

Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue
